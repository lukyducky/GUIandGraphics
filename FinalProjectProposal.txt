Final Project Proposal

SP-17


1. Overview
        My final project will be creating a simulation of raindrops hitting a pool of water.  I have an interest in how this could be done using shaders. I want to accomplish this as procedurally as possible- I think this can be accomplished using math to control some of the animations. As a stretch goal, I’ll have the user’s mouse position create extra ripples in the water, adding interactivity. 




2. Steps
1. Browse Three.js and get familiar with it; collect & find resource images.  Start w/coding if I have the time
2. Proceed with the coding: create just one rain/drop ripple effect to make sure it works and looks nice
3. Add in gradients for smoother ripple effects; duplicate them multiple times because there’s never just one raindrop in a puddle of water
4. Overlay several of these to reduce uniformity; work on finalizing the animations
5. (stretch goal:) Include user input: dragging mouse clicks to create more ripples.






3. Implementation
1. I will be doing this using webGL & Three.js.
